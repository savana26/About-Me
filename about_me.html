			<p>One thing that is associated to me, if you ask a close friend of mine, is how I love automotives. Cars, motorcycles, etc, you name it! 
			I really don't know why I loved cars for my whole life. Maybe because I came out of my mother's womb inside our car back then in 1998.
			The photo below is a picture of a W Motors Fenyr HyperSport, one of my favorite cars.

			<p>This video shows the trailer for the movie "Passengers." 
			I chose this movie trailer as my favorite video because I was just able to watch the movie recently, 
			but it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all time! 
			I would even recommend it to someone who asks for a must-watch movie because I'm certain they'd have no regrets watching it as well. 
			I'm not really a fan of space-themed films, but how the cinematography, action and suspense were created really blended to make it an amazing movie. 
			The lead actors, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, both did an exemplary job in portraying their characters. 
			Their personification of the main characters showed off their inexcusable talent. 
			And of course, the special effects and sound effects played a huge role in making this movie a total blockbuster. Two thumbs up to this movie!

			<p>I chose this song as my favorite audio because it recently became my favorite song. 
			I was first introduced to Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You", but when I heard to "Castle on a Hill", it quickly struck me and got my attention. 
			Most people nowadays listen to EDM, that's why the song "Shape of You" became popular, making this song underrated. 
			But then there's so much more to music than just the beat or the sound of electric instruments. 
			I like this song firstly because of its meaningful message. 
			Unlike other songs today, it tells of a man yearning and longing to go back to the happy times and memories after going through everything 
			that made life rough and tragic. Secondly, I like the musicality of the song. 
			I love the acoustic quality and rhythm of it and how everything fits perfectly. 
			And thirdly, I love how the artist, Ed Sheeran, sang it. 
			The way he sings with passion and with every bit of him is one of the best reasons that I look up to him as a singer and composer.
